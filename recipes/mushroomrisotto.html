            <p><i>Recipe from Good Food magazine, May 2009</i></p>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>50g Dried Porcini</li>
                <li>2 tbsp Olive Oil</li>
                <li>1 Onion</li>
                <li>2 Garlic Cloves</li>
                <li>250g Pack Chestnut Mushrooms</li>
                <li>300g Risotto Rice</li>
                <li>1 x 175ml Glass White Wine</li>
                <li>25g Butter</li>
                <li>Handful Parsley</li>
                <li>50g Parmesan</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Put 50g dried porcini mushrooms into a large bowl and pour over 1 litre boiling water. Soak for 20 mins, then drain into a bowl, discarding the last few tbsp of liquid left in the bowl.</li>
                <li>Crumble 1 vegetable stock cube into the mushroom liquid, then squeeze the mushrooms gently to remove any liquid.</li>
                <li>Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a shallow saucepan or deep frying pan over a medium flame. Add 1 finely chopped onion and 2 finely chopped garlic cloves, then fry for about 5 mins until soft.</li>
                <li>Stir in 250g chopped chestnut mushrooms and the dried mushrooms, season with salt and pepper and continue to cook for 8 mins until the fresh mushrooms have softened.</li>
                <li>Tip 300g risotto rice into the pan and cook for 1 min. Pour over a 175ml glass of white wine and let it bubble to nothing so the alcohol evaporates.</li>
                <li>Keep the pan over a medium heat and pour in a quarter of the mushroom stock. Simmer the rice, stirring often, until the rice has absorbed all the liquid.</li>
                <li>Add about the same amount of stock again and continue to simmer and stir - it should start to become creamy, plump and tender. By the time the final quarter of stock is added, the rice should be almost cooked.</li>
                <li>Continue stirring until the rice is cooked. If the rice is still undercooked, add a splash of water. Take the pan off the heat, add 25g butter and scatter over 25g grated parmesan or Grana Padano cheese and half a handful of chopped parsley leaves.</li>
                <li>Cover and leave for a few mins so that the rice can take up any excess liquid as it cools a bit. Give the risotto a final stir, spoon into bowls and scatter with the remaining 25g grated cheese and the remaining chopped parsley leaves.</li>
            </ol>
